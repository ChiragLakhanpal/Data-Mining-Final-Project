# Predicting CO2 Emissions Trends by Country

As we work towards the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement to reduce global warming and achieve a target of 1.5Â°C by 2100, it is important to understand and predict the drivers of greenhouse gas emissions. This project aims to predict CO2 emissions per capita in order to support the efforts of the Paris Agreement.
