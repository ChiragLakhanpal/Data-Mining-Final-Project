# Predicting-CO2-Emissions-Trend-by-Country

The 2015 Paris Agreement intends to keep global warming below 2℃ by 2100, with 1.5°C as a target. The majority of earlier evaluations of how plausible that is and what would be required to accomplish it were based on expert-based scenarios for the socioeconomic drivers of greenhouse gas emissions, and hence climate change. This project assisted in predicting the CO2 emissions per capita to corroborate the aforementioned Agreement.
